# ChromeBot-Update
I have fully implemented the night-mode version of chrome.
The Central Startup module is ChromeBotMain.java
Compile the Whole project directory, 
and run from the startup module: ChromeBotMain.java
You May compile each File Separately, or just use 
a Dependency Management Build tool such as Apache Ant, Apache  Maven
or Gradle .
